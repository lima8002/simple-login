# Welcome to your Simple Login App using Expo ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

# Firebase Configuration

This directory contains the Firebase configuration for the Simple Login App. After you create a Firebase project, you'll need to replace the values in `firebaseConfig.js` with your own and save on a folder called `utils`.

## firebaseConfig.js

The `firebaseConfig.js` file initializes the Firebase app and exports the necessary Firebase services. Here's an overview of its contents:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from "firebase/auth";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage),
});

export { auth };
```
